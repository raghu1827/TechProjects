# 🚀 TechProjects - Learning Backend by Doing  

Welcome to **TechProjects** – a hands-on learning space where I master backend technologies through real-world projects. Instead of just studying theory, I'm **building, coding, and solving problems** to understand how backend systems work in production environments.  

## 🔍 What's Inside?  
This repository is structured to help both beginners and experienced developers **apply concepts in real-world scenarios** while mastering core backend technologies.  

### 💻 Core Technologies  
✅ **Java & Java 8** – Mastering OOP, functional programming (Lambdas, Streams), concurrency, and JVM internals.  
✅ **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – Implementing sorting, searching, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and system design.  
✅ **Spring Framework & Spring Boot** – Learning dependency injection, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and RESTful APIs.  
✅ **Microservices Architecture** – Designing scalable applications using Spring Cloud, Kubernetes, API gateways, and event-driven architecture.  
✅ **SQL & Databases** – Writing efficient SQL queries, schema design, and database integration with backend applications.  
✅ **Advanced Backend Concepts** – Working with authentication, authorization, caching, logging, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines.  

## 🎯 Why This Repository?  
This project-driven approach ensures **deep learning through hands-on experience.** Here's why it's valuable:  

🚀 **Hands-on Learning** – Every project reinforces theoretical knowledge through practical coding.  
📌 **Structured Roadmap** – Progression from beginner to advanced ensures steady growth.  
🛠️ **Portfolio Building** – Projects here double as a strong portfolio for job applications.  
🧠 **Problem-Solving Mindset** – Tackling real-world backend challenges enhances critical thinking.  
🏆 **Industry-Relevant Skills** – Learn backend best practices used in top tech companies.
