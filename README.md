# 🚀 TechProjects - Learning Backend by Doing

Welcome to **TechProjects**! This repository is my hands-on learning space for mastering **backend technologies** like **Java, Java 8, Spring, DSA, Microservices, and SQL**. Instead of just studying theory, I'm following a **learn-by-doing** approach by building real-world projects, solving coding problems, and understanding how backend systems work in production environments.

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

This repository is structured to help both beginners and experienced developers gain deep knowledge of backend technologies by applying concepts in real-world scenarios.

### 💻 Core Technologies
- **Java & Java 8** - Mastering object-oriented programming, functional programming (Lambdas, Streams), concurrency, and JVM internals.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** - Implementing efficient problem-solving techniques with sorting, searching, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and system design.
- **Spring Framework & Spring Boot** - Learning dependency injection, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and creating RESTful APIs.
- **Microservices Architecture** - Designing scalable, distributed applications using Spring Cloud, Kubernetes, API gateways, and event-driven architecture.
- **SQL & Databases** - Understanding relational databases, writing efficient SQL queries, designing schemas, and integrating databases with backend applications.
- **Advanced Backend Concepts** - Working with authentication, authorization, caching, logging, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines for deployment.
